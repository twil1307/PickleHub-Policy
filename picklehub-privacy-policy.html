    <h1>Privacy Policy for PickleHub</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 28, 2025<br>
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 28, 2025
    </p>

    <p>PickleHub ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we
        collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our mobile app to discover pickleball courts
        and connect with other players.</p>

    <p>By using the PickleHub app, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Facebook Login Information</h3>
    <p>When you log in using Facebook, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>Your Facebook profile picture (avatar)</li>
        <li>Your Facebook user ID (for linking purposes only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> post on your behalf or access your full Facebook profile or friend list.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Optional User-Provided Data</h3>
    <p>You may optionally provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A short bio or skill level</li>
        <li>Preferred playing times or locations</li>
        <li>Contact preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Location Data</h3>
    <p>If you enable location access, we may collect your GPS coordinates to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Show nearby pickleball courts</li>
        <li>Recommend nearby users who are also looking for a match</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> store precise location data beyond what is needed to perform these functions, unless
        explicitly permitted by you.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate you via Facebook</li>
        <li>To personalize your user experience</li>
        <li>To help you discover nearby courts and connect with other players</li>
        <li>To maintain your user profile within the app</li>
        <li>To improve the app’s features and functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing or
        advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All user data is stored securely in our backend services (e.g., Firebase), which employ industry-standard
        encryption and access control mechanisms.</p>

    <p>Your Facebook user ID is stored only to maintain your identity across sessions. Other Facebook data (like name
        and email) is only stored if required for core functionality and is never shared outside the app.</p>

    <h3>3.1 Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We retain your personal data for as long as your account remains active or as needed to provide you with the
        app's services. If you delete your account, we will delete your data as described in Section 4. We may retain
        some data for a limited period if required for legal or regulatory obligations, dispute resolution, or to
        enforce our agreements.</p>

    <h3>3.2 International Data Transfers</h3>
    <p>Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of
        your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from
        those from your jurisdiction. By using PickleHub, you consent to such transfer of information.</p>

    <h2 id="data-deletion">4. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may request to delete your data at any time by contacting us via email (see Section 9). Upon request, we
        will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete your user profile from our database</li>
        <li>Unlink your Facebook ID</li>
        <li>Remove any optional data you’ve provided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services and Analytics</h2>
    <p>We use Firebase Authentication and Firestore to manage authentication and store data. These services are provided
        by Google and adhere to strict privacy and security guidelines.</p>
    <p>We may also use anonymized analytics tools (e.g., Firebase Analytics) to understand app usage and improve
        features. These tools do not collect personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party advertising services.</p>

    <h2>6. Limited Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public
        authorities (e.g., a court order or a government agency).</p>
    <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred. We will provide
        notice before your personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>PickleHub is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children under 13. If we become aware of such data, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>As a user, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access the data we store about you</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent (e.g., revoke location access or uninstall the app)</li>
    </ul>
